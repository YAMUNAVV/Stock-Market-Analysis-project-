## Python Stock Market Analysis:📊🔍
📈 Excited to share my latest stock market analysis project! 🚀
## 📁 Data Set and Description:
For this project, I utilized the "NIFTY-50 Stock Market Data (2000 – 2021)" data set, which includes historical stock data of various companies. However, my focus was on three Tata stocks – Tata Motors, Tata Steel, and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). The data consists of essential attributes such as Date, Symbol, Prev Close, Open, High, Low, Last, Close, VWAP, Turnover, Trades, Deliverable Volume, and % Deliverable.

## 📈 Project Overview:
In this analysis, I aimed to gain insights into the performance and trends of Tata Motors, Tata Steel, and TCS over the past two decades. By leveraging Python's data analysis and visualization libraries, I performed the following steps:

1️⃣ Data Cleaning: I handled missing values and ensured data consistency by converting date formats and dealing with any discrepancies.

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Through various visualizations and statistical measures, I studied the overall trends and volatility of the stocks. I explored correlations among different attributes to uncover interesting patterns.

3️⃣ Stock Performance Comparison: I compared the three Tata stocks based on their historical stock prices, identifying periods of significant growth or decline.

4️⃣ Moving Averages: I calculated and plotted the 50-day and 200-day moving averages to observe trends and potential crossovers, which are often used in technical analysis.

5️⃣ Trading Volume Analysis: I examined trading volumes and identified spikes or patterns that might signal potential price movements.

## 📊 Key Findings:
During this analysis, I made some intriguing discoveries, including [mention notable findings, e.g., periods of rapid growth, significant market events impacting the stocks]. These findings provided valuable insights into the Tata stocks' performance over the years.

## 📈 Next Steps:
I am excited to continue refining my data analysis skills and exploring more advanced trading strategies, including machine learning-based predictive models. The dynamic nature of the stock market motivates me to keep learning and adapting.
